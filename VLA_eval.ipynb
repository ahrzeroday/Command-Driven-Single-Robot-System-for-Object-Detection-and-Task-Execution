    "* **`check_release_over_tray()`**: Checks if the gripper is opening while positioned within the rectangular boundary (AABB) of the tray. This is a robust way to confirm the release location.\n",

    "## 4. Main Simulation and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key part that coordinates the whole process. It starts the simulation, and loads the VLA model, executes the evaluation episodes, drives the robot by model predictions, and, lastly, announces the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Initialization\n",
    "First, the script connects to the PyBullet physics engine with a graphical user interface (GUI) and loads the pre-trained VLA model (either the local fine-tuned version or the one from Hugging Face) onto the GPU. It also defines the natural language prompt for the task and initializes a dictionary to store the evaluation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. The Main Episode\n",
    "The script iterates for a predefined `NUM_EPISODES`. In each episode:\n",
    "1.  **Reset**: The environment is reset to a new, randomized configuration using `reset_environment()`.\n",
    "2.  **Visualize**: The debug camera is positioned to provide a clear view of the scene.\n",
    "3.  **Initialize Trackers**: Flags and variables for tracking the episode's progress (e.g., if a grasp was successful) are reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3. The Perception-Action Cycle\n",
    "This is the core of the robot's intelligence, where it repeatedly perceives, thinks, and acts. For each step within an episode:\n",
    "1.  **Perception**: It captures a 224x224 image from the virtual camera's perspective.\n",
    "2.  **Inference**: The captured image and the text prompt are passed to the VLA model. The model predicts the next action for the robot's arm and gripper.\n",
    "3.  **Action Processing**: The raw action predicted by the model is **smoothed** and **clipped**. Smoothing prevents jerky movements, and clipping ensures the robot doesn't try to move too far or too fast in a single step.\n",
    "4.  **Execution**:\n",
    "    * **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: The script calculates the necessary robot joint angles to move the gripper to the desired target position.\n",
    "    * **Motor Control**: It sends commands to the robot's motors to execute the calculated joint movements and gripper actions (open/close)."
